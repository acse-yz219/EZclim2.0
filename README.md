EZclim2.0
=================================

EZclim2.0 was developed in this project to enhance the scope of application of this EZclim1.0. EZclim1.0 was assessed in many aspects during this project. Various resolutions were provided to address its limitations. This has paved the way for creating EZclim2.0 to improve user experience by working on reasonable suggestions from different feedback. It has eventually attained three goals. It can be ported to JASMIN, it can operate pre-processing before diagnostics, and it can apply parallelization algorithms. This enhanced software version can manage various dataset types and process data faster. It is likewise convenient. Modifications are also possible for pre-processing steps. A progress bar is also provided to display the softwareâ€™s current status. Overall, creating EZclim2.0 has been successful. For how to use this software please see UserGuide
